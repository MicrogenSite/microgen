  There‚Äôs a new class of distributed database technologies building atop steady advances in IPLD & hash linked data structures in general. In this track we‚Äôll gather those brave enough to take on CAP theorem in a decentralized context, share notes on what‚Äôs working, and hear presentations from teams pushing the envelope on what databases can do and where they can exist.

    title: "Anchors Away (consistency in an IPFS world)"
    description: "Approaches to building consistent systems of distrusting peers. IPFS is mostly best effort protocols over a best effort DHT. How Ceramic Network uses a timestamp service (e.g ETH) to anchor events in time and produce mutable consistent streams of IPLD data.

    title: "Pando: Notarized IPLD Data Network"
    description: "There are a number of emerging streams of data that does not need to meet the same ‚Äòconsensus‚Äô bar as what we would expect in a global chain(Filecoin).  Pando is a huge forest of IPLD data structures and aggregate tons and tons and tons of data around Filecoin and then over time. There are nice properties of having this sort of data network more tightly linked to the chain that seem desirable to encourage, and this leads to the goals for the Pando:
* Keep included metadata consistently available
* Provide light-weight, unbiased access to metadata
* Discourage historical revisionism.

    title: "Querying Decentralized Data in Rhizomatic Systems"
    description: "Shifting storage and compute toward the far edge reflects an extreme departure from traditional cloud-based architectures, bringing with that shift a new set of challenges for application developers. Rhizome is a decentralized database for InterPlanetary Linked Data that embraces these challenges to open up new ways of thinking about consistency, interoperability, and privacy. 

This talk introduces the ideas underpinning Rhizome, and demonstrates how they come together to empower developers to build and reason about new types of peer-to-peer and decentralized applications.

    speakers: 'Alan Shaw'
    title: "Pail - DAG based sharded key/value store using Merkle Clocks and CRDTs"
    description: "Learn about a new a method of key/value storage implemented as an IPLD DAG. It details the format, encoding and mechanisms to mutate the storage as well as how to reconcile mutations made by multiple parties. Hint: Merkle Clocks and CRDTs.

We'll also learn about how you can leverage new web3.storage APIs to leverage decentralized, user controlled authorization for the data using UCANs.

    title: "About Koii Network new  settlement layer K2, and how efficiently it will solve the use cases"
    description: "1/ üì£ K2 has officially launched & we could not be more proud! 

K2 is our network's settlement layer that provides lightning fast transactions.

The K2 upgrades are a huge step forward for the network & for #Web3 as a whole. Here's what this means for the future of Koii.

2/ You can now run your own K2 node. ‚òä

When you run a K2 node, you‚Äôll help keep our network in sync and earn your share of the daily KOII mint. 

Validators share 10% of the daily tokens, so the earlier you start, the more you‚Äôll earn.




3/ The applications for K2 are infinite.

It enables blockchain bridges, decentralized social platforms üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª, #Web3 gamesüïπ, & more. 

We have 500+ ecosystem projects ready to build on Koii. K2 is the foundation for all of them, enabling a network of light-speed transactions."

    title: "Evaluating tradeoffs when representing database state"
    description: "Join us in this talk as we explore some of the tradeoffs and opportunities that come with building databases for the decentralized web. Building on past experience, new developments, and user needs, we will discuss proofs, queries, and the trials and tribulations of designing interplanetary databases.
