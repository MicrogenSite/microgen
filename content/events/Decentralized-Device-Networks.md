  We believe computing and AI can become more powerful and useful by embracing
  content addressing and a “merkle-native” way of doing things. In this track,
  we'll discuss various projects in this area, sharing R&D experiences, future
  directions, use cases, and benefits.

    speakers: Matt Hamilton
    name: 'FVM: The Filecoin Virtual Machine'
    description: >-
      I will cover the basics of what the FVM is, how Filecoin relates to IPFS
      and how you can use FVM to combine IPFS and Filecoin.

      Decentralized Off-chain Backends: How Autonolas utilizes IPFS across its
      stack to build trust-minimized off-chain services for DAOs
    description: >-
      Autonolas is an open-source software stack for the creation of
      decentralized, off-chain autonomous applications, called autonomous
      services, that can operate continuously, interact with the world outside
      of blockchains, run complex logic such as ML algorithms and are secured
      on-chain.

      Currently these are being used to power trust-minimized off-chain services
      for leading DAOs, including Balancer and Ceramic. 

      In this talk we will present how Autonolas leverages IPFS throughout its
      stack to: a) reference and retrieve code components, b) provide a
      production-grade package registry, and c) utilizes IPFS hashing to
      contribute to crypto-economic integrity of the system.

    name: Compute on data in space
    description: >-
      In this talk, we discuss how computation moves from Earth to space and how
      satellites start playing an important role in processing sensitive data
      and providing the cryptographic infrastructure much needed for privacy. We
      discuss a collaboration between Cryptosat and Project Bacalhau to enable
      executing workloads in space, with the goal of providing a seamless
      experience to its users while accessing a Trusted Execution Environment
      literally out of this world.

      AI, Data, and You - Driving AI Precision with Decentralized Access
      Control 
    description: >-
      AIs trained on publicly available data have a problem: their inferences
      source content that may or may not have consented to use. Controlling how
      AIs source their training data will influence how publishers receive
      proper attribution in the not-too-distant future. Additionally, the data
      that's used for training is hitting its limit. The response: access to
      private datasets will be the rate limiting factor for AIs to maintain
      their competitive advantage. These two issues are intertwined, and working
      towards their resolution will help advance AI adoption and growth. 
  - time: '08:15 - 08:45'
    speakers: Iryna Tsimashenka
    name: Bacalhau - decentralised compute over data
    description: >-
      Bacalhau is a new project of Protocol Labs, which allows computation over
      data (COD) stored on IPFS. You are going to learn exciting use cases,
      architecture and what problems are solved by using Bacalhau

    name: 'IPVM: Content Addressed Compute for an Open World'
    description: >-
      Curious about the latest from the IPVM WG? This talk presents updates from
      the working group: a high-level overview of IPVM, standards to date, the
      latest roadmap, and lessons learned so far. This includes invocation and
      workflow models, a (pluggable) effect system, a principled approach to
      partial failure, open interop, kernel functionality, private data
      handling, and the most common question: what IPVM is *not*!

    name: 'Foundations for Open-World Compute: Homestar, an IPVM Tale'
    description: >-
      At Fission, we've been laying down the groundwork for an IPVM
      implementation called Homestar, a distributed compute engine built with
      IPFS and IPLD at its core, along with first-class support for the Wasm
      (WebAssembly) Component Model and Interface Types, a vision for managed
      effects, and primitives for open-world replayability, capability discovery
      (Ucan capabilities specifically), and execution coordination. In this
      talk, we'll predominantly focus on the deterministic Wasm subset of the
      engine, particularly on why we've sided with the Wasm Component model, how
      we bidirectionally translate between IPLD and Wasm Interface Types at
      runtime, and aim to achieve a legitimate &#34;write once, run
      anywhere&#34; ethos. We'll also dive into approaches related to the
      monumental challenge involving open-world interoperability, especially in
      the context of other distributed workflow frameworks and toward the goal
      of fault-oblivious computing.
