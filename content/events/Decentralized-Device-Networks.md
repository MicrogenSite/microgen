  We believe computing and AI can become more powerful and useful by embracing content addressing and a “merkle-native” way of doing things. In this track, we'll discuss various projects in this area, sharing R&D experiences, future directions, use cases, and benefits.

    title: "Project Lilypad: On Chain FVM Smart Contracts Invoking Off Chain Compute Over IPFS"
    description: "Compute networks like Bacalhau have enable users to execute trustless tasks over immutable data stored in IPFS. Now with Project Lilypad, developers can create full stack immutable applications by combining the the programmability and payments of FVM smart contracts with the off chain immutable infrastructure of IPFS and Bacalhau.

In this talk we'll cover the architecture of Project Lilypad and some fun new use cases it enables such as generative art (Project Waterlily), community building with generative NFTs, and enhanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) primitives.

    title: "Foundations for Open-World Compute: Homestar, an IPVM Tale"
    description: "At Fission, we've been laying down the groundwork for an IPVM implementation called Homestar, a distributed compute engine built with IPFS and IPLD at its core, along with first-class support for the Wasm (WebAssembly) Component Model and Interface Types, a vision for managed effects, and primitives for open-world replayability, capability discovery (Ucan capabilities specifically), and execution coordination. In this talk, we'll predominantly focus on the deterministic Wasm subset of the engine, particularly on why we've sided with the Wasm Component model, how we bidirectionally translate between IPLD and Wasm Interface Types at runtime, and aim to achieve a legitimate &#34;write once, run anywhere&#34; ethos. We'll also dive into approaches related to the monumental challenge involving open-world interoperability, especially in the context of other distributed workflow frameworks and toward the goal of fault-oblivious computing.

    title: "AquaVM: pi-calculus based distributed algorithms"
    description: "At Fluence we are developing an open stack solution called Aquamarine that allows developers to choreograph and compose distributed, peer-to-peer hosted services. An integral pillar of this stack is CRDT-based AquaVM (http://github.com/fluencelabs/aquavm). It is the Rust-based AIR interpreter compiles to WebAssembly and allows for the seamless orchestration of peer-to-peer hosted, Wasm-based services. AIR is our own intermediate representation inspired by pi and lambda calculus as well as category theory.
In this talk, we'll discuss the use of AIR and how these different math topics were used for AquaVM architecturing from scratch including AI applications.

    title: "Decentralized Off-chain Backends: How Autonolas utilizes IPFS across its stack to build trust-minimized off-chain services for DAOs"
    description: "Autonolas is an open-source software stack for the creation of decentralized, off-chain autonomous applications, called autonomous services, that can operate continuously, interact with the world outside of blockchains, run complex logic such as ML algorithms and are secured on-chain.

Currently these are being used to power trust-minimized off-chain services for leading DAOs, including Balancer and Ceramic. 

In this talk we will present how Autonolas leverages IPFS throughout its stack to: a) reference and retrieve code components, b) provide a production-grade package registry, and c) utilizes IPFS hashing to contribute to crypto-economic integrity of the system.

    title: "Federated Learning on FVM"
    description: "In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn the fundamentals of federated machine learning with FVM through a brief introduction, followed by a hands-on activity. They will learn how to set up and manage a federated learning environment, how to design and train models using federated learning techniques, and how to analyze and evaluate the performance of federated models and deploy their models to FVM. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a practical understanding of the key concepts and skills needed to implement federated machine learning with FVM in their own projects.

    title: "AI data & compute - AI scaling limits solved via decentralisation"
    description: "The scale of an AI system is limited by data and compute availability. Access to data is in jeopardy due to attribution issues and the associated legal challenges, whereas compute is stockpiled and price-gouged by cloud oligopolists. Decentralised protocols offer programmatic solutions to both problems and uncap the positive impact that AI systems can have on society.
