# Tips

## Failing Builds

- Make sure your environment variables are set correctly, see the `.env.example` file for the current version of these.

- The Tina Token must use an asterisk (wildcard) or include the Tina Branch name your are building.

- Github must have all your changes when building locally, Tina uses this version of the schema even for local builds.
