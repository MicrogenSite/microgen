  The world wide web is both the biggest deployment vector and least tractable surface for IPFS. There are opportunities and major challenges to bringing IPFS support in web rendering engines and browsers, to web content served through gateways, to IPFS network access from HTTP web apps and browser extensions. This track will have talks on: current and future browser implementations, approaches to managing and publishing IPFS content on the web, building apps that connect to the IPFS from within HTTP contexts, culminating in planning for group working sessions around on specific IPFS+Web challenges on day 4 & 5 of IPFS Thing.

    title: "What Is The Web?"
    description: "What is the Web? Interestingly, that question has never been answered before. This talk proposes that the Web is about user agency, and Web technology is the set of technology that increases user agency. I'll explain the reasons for taking this view, and show how that maps to technical architecture and gives us a sense of where to take the web next.

    title: "Content Based Addressing and the Web Security Model"
    description: "The web security model relies on a combination of mechanisms to provide origin isolation and prevent some classes of attacks: the Same Origin Policy and Content Security Policies. While effective for their goals, these mechanisms also have side effects that prevent legitimate applications to be built on the Web.
In this talk we'll explore how content based addressing can be leveraged to build 
different security models that enable a new class of Web apps.

    description: "ODD.js is a toolkit that allows you to build a distributed web application where the user is in full control of their data thanks to WNFS and UCAN. We’ll take a look at which additional layers are built on top of WNFS and how UCAN is utilised throughout this. ODD.js is built by the folks at Fission, but that doesn’t necessarily mean your web application is tied to the Fission infrastructure. This SDK allows various components to be customised and swapped out, as we did with Walletauth, where MetaMask is used as the identity layer.
